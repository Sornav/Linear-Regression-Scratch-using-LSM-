# Linear-Regression-Scratch-using-LSM-
Implemented the Linear Regression model from scratch,without using any advanced library functions,this was specifically done by me,so as to the compare its Mean Squared Error with the earlier Linear Regression model which I did using Gradient Descent

**Note:I usually visualize my data by using Plotly Library,so if you are having trouble viewing them in the GitHub viewer, you are free to clone my repository on your local machine and check them out in jupyter notebook.
